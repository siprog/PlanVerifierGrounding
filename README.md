# PlanVerifierGrounding
This is implementation of the version of the plan verifier introduced in the article:  On the impact of grounding on htn plan verification via parsing by Simona Ondrčková, Roman Barták, Pascal Bercher, and Gregor Behnke ICTAI 2023
This implementation of the described verifier is created by Simona Ondrčková.
We provide three versions: the BFS with implementation improvements (main branch), DFS One by One and DFSAtOnce (in their respective branches).
We also provide an example of a 2-regulated and grounded domain.
